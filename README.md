## Approach

1.  Data Exploration/Visualization
    -  Assess and visualize impact of different features on poverty level
    -  Find important features
        -  Manually from visualization
        -  Using sklearn feature selection

2.  Cleaning
    -  Decide on how to handle null values
    -  Encoding necessary? 
    
3.  Feature Selection/Engineering
    -  Finalize features to include in model
    -  Perform logical transformations.
    
4.  Classification
    -  Try various models and report accuracy
    
5.  Tuning of hyper-parameters
